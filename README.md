# Outlook Ad Remover

Simple extension to remove the Ad pane in the Outlook Live Webpage (outlook[dot]live[dot]com/mail/0/). Similar to an Ad Blocker, but if you have an Ad Blocker installed it will still have a pane present telling you to sign up for Ad-Free Outlook.

Simply clone repo and then load extension as unpacked (requires developer mode to be turned on in extension management).

**Currently only developed for Chromium based browsers.**
